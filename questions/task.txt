Hi Sarah,

There are some questions that I want to clarify as following:

- Regarding of the labels of next event, what is the "x" seconds mean, any event that happen first, because most of the time in database, the price remain unchanged? Or the question meaning that if any change in best bid-ask may happen in next few seconds? If possible, please help to clarify if my understanding is correct as following:
def nextEventLogic(df):
    if df['bid_change'] < 0:
        return 1
    elif df['ask_change'] >0:
        return 2
    else:
        return 0


- What is the roughly nature of these fields: 1s_side, 3s_side and 5s_side?

Thank you very much.

Best Regards,
Vinh
